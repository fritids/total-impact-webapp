        <h3 id="history">history</h3>
        <p>ImpactStory began life as total-impact, a hackathon project at the Beyond Impact workshop in 2011. As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into a hotel hallway to continue working, eventually completing a 24-hour coding marathon to finish a prototype. After months of spare-time development and then funding, we’ve got the same excitement for total-impact today.</p>

        <p>In early 2012, ImpactStory was given £17,000 through the <a href="http://www.beyond-impact.org/">Beyond Impact project</a> from the <a href="http://www.soros.org/">Open Society Foundation</a>.  As of May 2012, ImpactStory is funded through a $125k grant from the <a href="http://sloan.org/">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. </a></p>
